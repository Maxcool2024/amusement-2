Birthday Celebration with friends, college party, a family outing, a romantic date with partner, a school picnic, meeting a new face book friend or simply to 
unwind, which is the place you think people of India visit for all these purposes? Amusement parks are the answer. Amusement parks in India are the new hot spots 
where people like to spend all of whatever leisure time they have. These amusement parks take care of everything that a person can possibly desire for in his hours 
of luxury. Standing true to their name, these parks offer unlimited amusement and fun to people. A wide array of rides for children and adults, a plethora of eating 
options, numerous shopping outlets and foot tapping music qualifies them among one of the most sought after places of entertainment. The dose of entertainment also 
includes live concerts and shows in some of these parks. The overall ambiance of these places is such that they help in lifting low spirits many a time. The industry 
of amusement parks in India is growing at a rapid pace along with growing standard of living. These parks are serving the elite sections of the society since a long 
time but with bourgeois classes rising economically and willing to pay big bucks to have few light moments with their loved ones, their number is on an ever 
increasing high. These amusement parks are even serving as important centers of business meetings. They are proving to be instrumental tools to boost tourism in 
India with many of them making to travel advisories issued by the government of India. Essel World in Mumbai, Nicco Park in Kolkata, Adventure Island &Fun and Food 
Village in New Delhi are few of the well known amusement parks in the country. These parks have not only been successful in making a mark for themselves but they 
have also set an example for the others in the line.</p>
